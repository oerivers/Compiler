# Compiler
This is the repository for my final project of the course [Compilators]. Periodically going to change the code- expect this to stop getting changes until Nov. 25th of the current year.

# Instructions
To run the project simply run the main.py file and see the result of the test.mb code in the console. If you would like to- please feel free to change the code in the test.mb file to write your own code. Please be advised you must then run the main.py again.
